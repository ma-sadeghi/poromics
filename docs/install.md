# Installation

To install `poromics`, you can use `pip`, but we highly recommend using `uv` instead, as it is significantly faster. `uv` is a drop-in replacement for `pip`, so you can use it in the same way.

## Using `uv`

1. Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
2. [Create a virtual environment](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/) (or activate an existing one, e.g., `conda` or `pyenv`)
3. Run the following command in a terminal/command prompt:

```shell
uv pip install poromics
```

## Using `pip`

1. Create a virtual environment (or activate an existing one, e.g., `conda` or `pyenv`)
2. Run the following command in a terminal/command prompt:

```shell
pip install poromics
```
